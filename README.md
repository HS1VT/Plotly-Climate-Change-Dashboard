We analyze and plot the datasets on a map using "Plotly" and "Dash"

Our task will be to create a climate change dashboard using the datasets here. It is up to you, how many datasets you want to include and how you want to set them up. We would like to plot this data in a world map and produce an interactive report.  For example, you can produce some charts from: https://www.climate4you.com/Text/Climate4you_February_2022.pdf (Links to an external site.)

For example, per country CO2 emissions till 2014 are available here: https://github.com/datasets/co2-fossil-by-nation

We also normalize the time series and build clusters and plot them in your dashboard.
